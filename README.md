# Travel agency

My project is a webpage containing  packages  that  customer is able  to select, inquire about them through email, view location of them on google map and read some information about packages as well as  countries and cities about their desired package.

## Demo



# UX

This project is for  any customer who is willing  to  go for all inclusive cheap holidays. There is a variety of packages  to pick from. By clicking on a desired package or  on contact form  user  can send  email with all the necessary information  needed.

## User story:
User wants to see which packages  are  available, simply press on  holiday deals  button on navigation bar  and  it will lead him to  3 packages that are available, including their name, a quote and  price.

User wants to get more information about  Spain package simply press on the image or header and it wil take him to the  page of package,showing him exact city, information about that city and what you can see there as well as what  the package includes.

User wants to  get in contact  directly, under the contact us page user can send  email directly with  all the desired questions and information.

If user wants to see exactly where the city is located or where  the hotel from package is, user can go to navigation bar locations button and user will get Google map with  set markers for all three packages. User can also zoom in by pressing on marker and  user will be able to see all of the attractions and restaurants around  the hotel of  each package.

I was using Just in mind protoyper. To make a wireframe of the idea that I had for my project. From how it would look to where would text go and how many images,how many pages.
The wireframe is included  in assets folder in wireframe folder.Of course with going deeper into the making of project itself wireframe as such had to adapt and develop to better suit the need of the project itself.
